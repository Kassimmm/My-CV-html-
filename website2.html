 		<h3> <b> <i> PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY </i> </b> </h3>
 			      I am very respectful, committed and hardworking with excellent communication skills.
            For academic objectives, I have a high sense of creativity, initiative responsibility, and self-motivation.
            <br>
            I have a strong talent for algebra and arithmetic and very invested in my work, putting in long hours and going above and beyond what was required of me. I was not surprised I graduated with one of the best grades in the year 2020 in SHS.
            <br>
            Computer science, on the other hand, is my lifelong passion. I have always been quite engaged in institution's technological circuit, as a member of the Science and Technology team.
            My personal qualities are as impressive as my intellectual accomplishments. As an extremely kind and hardworking boy, I sincerely hope that I will be accepted in any institution without any reservation.
